//Inheritance: an OOP where you can define a hierarchical relationship amongst classes
//a base class AKA superclass AKA parent class
//a derived class AKA subclass AKA child class
//a subclass inheirts the state and behavior from a superclass
//in swift, structs do not support inheritance
//in swift, there is no universal base class
//for example, there is no Object lke there is in Java
//use the keyword super to refer a member of the superclass
//use the keyword oveverride to override behavior or state in a subclass
